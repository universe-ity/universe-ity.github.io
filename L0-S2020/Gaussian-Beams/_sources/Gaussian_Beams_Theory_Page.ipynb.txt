A knife edge scan involves taking something with a sharp edge like a knife or razer blade and translating the edge (in the direction perpendicular to the edge and beam) across the beam so that the edge cuts through the beam until the edge completely blocks the beam. Below is a schematic/drawing ([source](http://imagebank.osa.org/getImage.xqy?img=cCF6ekAuZnVsbCxvZS0xNS0xMC02MzY3LWcwMDE&article=oe-15-10-6367-g001))\n",

This amounts to the sum of the intensity of the beam at each position in the transverse direction ie $x$-direction (remember, longitudinal direction is the beam propogation direction). In other words, what is measured is the integral of the Gaussian intensity profile upto the x-position where the edge starts (blocking the light). \n",
