    "In this lab you will be making use of OSLO, a powerful, professional optical raytracing program. While OSLO may seem a bit obtuse at first, the hope is that the guide herein will be able to demystify the methods of using OSLO to solve your problems. By mastering OSLO you should be able to accurately simulate optical experiments similar to what you would have been performing in the physical lab."
