    "In optics an afocal system - afocal meaning a system without focus - is an optical system that produces no net convergence or divergence of the rays. In other words, an afocal system is a system of lenses that does not focus the rays which is equivalent to having an infinite focal length. \n",

    " An example of an afocal optical system is an optical telescope, the light from a faraway object entering the system is considered to be at \"infinity\" and the image it forms is thus also at \"infinity\" since the system does not converge or diverge the rays. Although the system does not alter the divergence of the \"parallel\" rays, it does alter the separation of the rays, thus increasing magnification. The magnification of such a system is given by\n",

    "Telescopes are used for viewing distant objects, producing an image that is larger than the image that can be seen with the naked eye.

    "\n",
    "> The human eye may be described (approximately) as a 1-inch-diameter water-filled sphere with a focusing lens assembly, adjustable iris, and a high-resolution sensor (the retina) at its image surface. The typical eye has a focal length of 17.3 mm, a variable f-number from f/2.5 to f/17, and adjustable focus from infinity down to 10 inches. While the full field of view of the eye is approximately 140 deg, the area of useful imagery is limited to about 90 deg. The optics of the eye are configured to reduce residual spherical aberration, while chromatic aberration remains uncorrected. The area of optimum resolution at the retina is referred to as the fovea. In most cases, when forming an image at the fovea, the optics of the eye exhibit image quality (spot size) that is from 2 to 4 times worse than the diffraction limit. Normal visual acuity is 1 arc minute, meaning that under normal conditions the eye will resolve a high-contrast, repeating pattern of equal width bars and spaces, when each element of that pattern subtends an angle of 1 arc minute to the eye. In order to be effective, the designer of optical instruments for visual applications must take into account all of the physical and optical characteristics that have been presented here.\n",
