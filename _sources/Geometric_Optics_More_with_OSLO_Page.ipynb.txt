        "When attempting to optimize a multi-lens system in OSLO it is benificial to use the slider wheel. This eliminates the need to type numbers repeatedly into a spreadsheet, and gives better control on seeing when the system is optimized. The \"slider-wheel\" feature of OSLO creates a linear slider control that changes a variable (\"wheel\" is in reference to the fact that the mouse's scroll-wheel can be used to change the value.)\n",

        "To create a slider-wheel, go to the <code>optimize</code> menu, select <code>Slider-Wheel Design</code> and fill in the desired elements. You may also choose to display aberration curves such as Optical Path Difference (OPD) or ray error (Ray-intercept). You can read more on these aberration curve in [Chapter 33 of the Handbook for Optics](http://www.photonics.intec.ugent.be/education/IVPV/res_handbook/v1ch33.pdf). If no such curves are desired, you can of course select <code>Draw only</code>.\n",
